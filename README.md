# SierpinskiFractal

The Sierpiński triangle, also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal attractive set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided into smaller equilateral triangles.

This interactive demo displays how it works.



## How it works

To begin with, three points are drawn - each representing a corner of our triangle.     
Two of these points are then randomly selected, and a new point is drawn between the two aforementioned points.     
A new point is then randomly selected (it can not be the most recently drawn point), and a new point is drawn between this one, and the newly added point from the previous step.     
This process is then repeated over and over.     
     
  You will notice a pattern emerges. This happens every time, but it has never been mathematically proven, which is why I found it interesting enough to make this little demo.
